They also participate in workshops using body-centered writing, moment work, visual arts, and embodied listening to produce creation-scholarship in a medium of their choice. Taught in conjunction with ANTH 296N; students cannot receive credit for this course and ANTH 296N. Prerequisite(s): Satisfaction of the Entry Level Writing and Composition requirements; and ANTH 1, ANTH 2, and ANTH 3. Enrollment is restricted to senior anthropology majors and by permission of instructor.

VThe phenomenon of  losing your native language  is well attested anecdotally by many speakers who are separated from their first language environment. Course provides a broad overview of first language attrition (loss) in different populations including adult native speakers, children, international adoptees, heritage speakers, and bilingual returnees. Examines the linguistic aspects of attrition in order to determine which areas of language are typically impacted by attrition, then focuses on individual differences (e.g., identity) and contextual factors (e.g., input) that may speed up or prevent attrition. Emphasizes considering first language attrition and second language (L2) acquisition as two inseparable sides of bilingualism, both in individual speakers and in bilingual communities.

VGames are art forms that are widely accessed across a multitude of modern social, cultural, political, and media landscapes. Many games\u2014from ancient to contemporary\u2014express compelling sociopolitical perspectives and critiques. This course explores games as art with a focus on works that intentionally invite social action and change through performance, play, or participation. Games are discussed from critical, artistic, and aesthetic frameworks. Creative assignments and projects are used to explore methods and approaches for creating expressive games and other forms of radical play.

Legal papers, as a violent affirmation of settler sovereignty, do not capture the complexities of who we are, much less all our relations\u2014to each other, to place, to life worlds. By exploring those complexities, we strive to create a communal space where we courageously articulate self, community, and relationality in ways that state documents must disavow.

The capstone project must engage with a real-world partner(s) on a scalable opportunity for solving a critical problem in coastal areas (from land to sea). Faculty lead mini-lectures as needed. Course stresses learning-by-doing: weekly assignments have students work outside of class on steps or skills in the design process and then the student shares their work in the following class to gain peer insights. Students should expect to do the reading and a substantial assignment each week BEFORE the class session meets.

VWhat would we learn about the pressing questions of our time if we centered sound, noise, voice, and music? To think with sound or to think sonically "is to think conjuncturally about sound and culture." Such a "sonic imagination," not only enables us to immerse ourselves in the questions and problems of our time but has the potential to "redescribe them from unexpected standpoints." Thinking with a feminist and sonic imagination, this course is interested in exploring conjunctures and culture by using sound as its point of departure. It serves as an immersive introduction to sound studies and as a senior seminar encourages students to center soundscapes in their own research.

These communication skills can be used while in Israel for either traveling purposes or attending classes in one of the universities as part of the learning abroad programs. Students acquire the skills required for practical use of Hebrew in order to communicate everyday life activities along with specific functional tasks, such as understanding directions; ordering in a restaurant; health issues; dealing with security issues and emergency situations; understanding tour guides; and addressing historical, political, and geographical issues.

Examples range from peasant revolts to labor movements, feminist struggles to anti-war mobilizations, prisoner uprisings to anti-colonial wars and contemporary forms of corporeal, self-sacrificial resistance. Relying upon the concrete political problems posed by each historical instance as springboards into larger theoretical concerns, the course focuses on questions such as the nature of power relations, different forms of political organization and representation, the relationship between means and ends, the role of violence, and the function of different media, especially as they become manifest in the complexity of real politics.

Themes include: questions of orientation and disorientation, production and annihilation, city and hinterland, interior and exterior, subjection and liberation. Also focuses on problems of race and class as they inform capitalism, and experiments with practices of psycho-geography on walks or "drifts" across campus.

What forces have caused and maintained inequalities in labor forces across the globe? How does global production isolate, divide, and separate workers from one another?

Course addresses questions central to the Marxist tradition: What is capital? What is capitalism? What is a capitalist state? How did Marx understand colonialism and national liberation struggles? What is the specific nature of gendered oppression and exploitation under capitalism? What is the relationship between capitalist production and cultural production?

VSurvey course of antiracism literatures in the U.S. that introduces students to critical whiteness studies, a field of research, thought, and embodied antiracist practice that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s and is currently provoking renewed interest. Students think through the genealogy of whiteness studies and its origins in Black studies and movements to gain ethnic studies programs on campuses in California. Also considers the position of whiteness studies within the fields of critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and political economy. It is important to note that this course is less a critical response to whiteness studies than an introduction to and survey of the field.

VUtopia translates to "no place" though it sounds identical to another Greek word, "eutopia," or "good place." This double meaning speaks to the desire for the ideal society coupled with the very impossibility of its creation. While the term utopia originated in the tradition of political philosophy, this course opens up discussion to a range of utopian thinking in the domains of literature, philosophy, and theory. Some of the questions students tackle are: What are some common elements of utopian imaginaries? Are utopias always already dystopias? How is the concept of utopia connected to the way we shape and experience space? Close reading and discussion of written and visual texts is complemented by analytical and creative writing exercises that engage the themes.

VExamines modern humanism and its critics in a trajectory composed of three moments: foundational texts of 19th century humanism and some of their 20th century interpreters, the critiques of humanism launched by structuralist/post-structuralist continental theory in the 1960s that dealt with the essentialization of the human (theoretical anti-humanism), and contemporary critiques that take issue with anthropocentrism (posthumanism/transhumanism). Students consider thematics that have shaped humanism and the controversies surrounding it including questions of secularism, morality, and materialism, essentialism and class/gender/racial identity, anthropocentrism, and universalism. Readings include Feuerbach, Marx, Sartre, Heidegger, Foucault, Althusser, Haraway, Braidotti, and Ferrando.

VThere is a history of political consciousness that culminated in the project of enlightenment. There is a history of individual, collective, and political unconscious, which culminated in fascism. These two histories are intertwined, but their outcome is not preconceived. On the contrary, their relationship and integration constitute a field of possibilities for social, political, and human experimentation. This course inquires into the concept of political unconscious by exploring thinkers, such as Kant, Foucault, Adorno, Horkheimer, Freud, Jung, Reich, Fromm, Marcuse, and Klein.

Discusses whether or not these different works fit together into a single tradition called "critical theory" and what theoretical and political implications the gesture of such naming entails. Investigates the normative foundations of critique and the philosophical influences that shape them. Course also explores the different "generations" of the Frankfurt School and map out the relationship of these thinkers to the traditions of Western Marxism, psychoanalysis, and social theory.

VBefore the 20th century, the horse was, for humans, the most important animal: quickening the pace of travel; facilitating hunting and herding; providing traction for agriculture and industry; enabling the formation of cavalries that projected military power. The horse and rider became the subject of powerful myths, from the Arthurian legends of the Middle Ages through the American Western of our own time. Only with the advent of modern engines and motors did role of the horse begin to recede in human history. Course examines the human/equine partnership over a period of 6,000 years, from the beginning of domestication to the middle of the 20th century.

VAddresses the role of values in technology: Who is technology for? What could it be? How does it relate to its social and historical contexts? Students think systematically and imaginatively about how the design of different technologies assists and constrains everyday life. Course asks whether there is a "right" way to do technology, and if there is, how we might go about pursuing it. To explore this question, the course draws on cross-disciplinary materials taken from literature, history, sociology, anthropology, politics, and philosophy, and introduces students to the principles of design justice and inclusive design.

Assesses the holistic picture of technological development: the historical context of several technologies, how they affect the environment, who works to build the components, and who becomes the experts of how we address social problems. Students debate these issues and consider how we might propose alternative solutions or interact differently with technologies and the worlds they offer.

This seminar examines current debates and representations in various media, working collaboratively to understand the political dimensions of what we designate in simple terms as \u201cclimate change\u201d, but which really encompasses a broad range of interrelated natural and social phenomena. Students develop critical interdisciplinary research projects within thematic groups that explore more specific topics\u2014e.g., strategic failures of cosmopolitanism, eco-fascism and climate migration, biodiversity and land enclosure, the Green New Deal vs. degrowth, or the ethics of sabotage.

Course content is divided into weekly modules that move thematically through topics including cultural encounter, colonial systems of oppression, and anti-colonial theorization of dance. Presenting critical perspectives on the role dance has played throughout the colonial period to the present, this course encourages different ways of considering the Americas as a sociological concept not bound by geography, but mobilized through dancing bodies.

The second half of the course turns to the 21st century War on Terror, highlighting the kidnappings, torture, and assassinations perpetrated by the secrecy state, with an eye on the role of the court system as a vehicle for exposure and redress.

And while some of us are probably aware of the fact that racial and ethnic categories are "constructed," most of us have probably not considered the ways in which language use figures in the construction of ethnic and/or racial identity. Course introduces a number of racialized linguistic varieties and their intersections with other identity categories (gender, sexuality, socio-economic class), as well as emergent new scholarship on language and racialization.

Understanding that spaces of social collaboration are also learning environments, students investigate how different models of student engagement promote agency ultimately leading to investigating how we can utilize our agency to effect change and how dialogue plays an integral role in this process. Also explores effective practices for fostering and implementing agency and communication, and the theories from which these practices emerge.

VCollaboration can be challenging, particularly in a society in which there is an emphasis on individualism and competitiveness. Compromise, for example, can be experienced or interpreted as personal sacrifice rather than fertile ground for possibility. Solving many of the world's most significant issues (climate change, economic instability, pandemic, etc.) will require collective effort and this will challenge us to create new ways of being and thinking. Through classroom discussions, journal reflections, and experiential exercises, students investigate models of collaboration, how social inequities can challenge collaborative work, the importance of common purpose, practices that support respectful and inclusive deliberation, and student organizations as sites of collaboration. Enrollment is by permission and is restricted to students who are a member of a SOMeCA organization.

VOcean data collection has increased dramatically with much of this information available publicly for consumption and analysis by the scientific and broader community. Yet the format of available information differs often by platform, and useful visualization techniques depend on the type of data being considered. Class introduces different types of publicly available data, develops tools needed to access this information locally, and discusses broad methods for visualization appropriate for time-series, maps, sections, vector fields, and animations. Students develop their own capabilities through assignments using a scientific programming language of their choice (e.g., julia, python, matlab, or R), and lectures introduce necessary programming ideas and examples to support student-based tool development.

These constitute an important counterexample to any claim that the problems and approaches of continental and analytic philosophy cannot be fruitfully integrated, or that analytic philosophy remains fated to be ahistorical. Course examines how Kant and Hegel, and Heideggar as well, powerfully inform the philosophical writings of all three. Also investigates how Sellars articulates an original philosophical vision that his younger colleagues and intellectual heirs at Pittsburgh further develop and yet make their own.

VAnalytic philosophy remains the dominant philosophical style worldwide. As a style of philosophy, analytic philosophy places emphasis on logical form and on the use of logical structure as the key element for evaluating the normative status (the logical merits) of a specific position. The history of analytic philosophy remains key since core debates turn on the status of logic as a supposedly value-neutral tool. This impacts philosophical understanding regarding logic, mathematics, and the relation of these areas to the natural and social sciences.

VThe fundamentals of quantum materials are revamped by incorporating the geometric Berry phase and the topology of quantum wave functions. The traditional solid-state phenomena of superconductivity and magnetism are taught from a cutting-edge topological perspective, to understand phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect and emergent Majorana fermions. Applications of topological quantum materials range from spintronics to quantum information and computation. (Formerly offered as PHYS 155, Solid State Physics.)

By treating the pandemic this way as portal for the re-imagination and remaking of global and community health, the course focuses on moving systematically from evidence about disease, its inequalities, and policy responses to ideas about improving health outcomes both locally and globally.

VDemocracy is an essential political concept, and a fundamentally contested one. Since the 1980s, scholars of comparative politics have attempted to explain why and when countries transition from authoritarianism to democratic institutions. However, regime change at the national level only sets the stage, leaving deeper questions about what democracy means in practice--how it plays out (or is undermined) throughout the state and at subnational levels; whom it includes and excludes; what options it opens; and what possibilities it forecloses. Such questions relate debates about the potential and the limitations of democracy in general.

VExplores major debates on the role and rule of law in society, with attention to efforts to use law to seek justice or respond to injustice. This includes engaging in three overlapping sets of conversations: What is law\u2014its sources and functions\u2014and how, where, and on whom does it operate? What is the "rule of law"\u2014what is it for and whom does/can it serve and how? What are different ways that people and groups grapple with or respond to the role of law in injustice\u2014including "the Nazi problem," "the slavery problem," the colonialism/imperialism problem, the Jim Crow/apartheid problem, etc\u2014and what are the possibilities, challenges, and limits? Theoretical perspectives on the sources/origins and role of law in society will be considered as well as case studies and concrete examples that show how this tool is applied to particular challenges.

These questions included: What is/are the Islamic understanding(s) of the purpose of individual and collective lives? What does freewill mean in Islam, and what is its relationship to responsibility towards oneself and one's community? Is there an Islamic notion of justice, and how does it relate to the way justice is defined by other intellectual traditions? What are the legitimate ways of exercising social and political authority to establish the Islamic vision(s) of the good life? How is establishing that vision related to the notion of jihad (striving in the path of God)? What implications does that vision, and its concomitant notions of justice and freewill, have on developing an Islamic understanding of the relationship between different genders, classes, and human groups?
